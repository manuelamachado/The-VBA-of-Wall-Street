# The VBA of Wall Street

### Background

Mastering Excel VBA ! I used VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 

### Scope:

* Created a script that will loop through each year of stock data and grab the total amount of volume each stock had over the year.

* Created a script that will loop through all the stocks and take the following info.

   * Yearly change from what the stock opened the year at to what the closing price was.

   * The percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed.

   * The total Volume of the stock

   * Ticker symbol

* Created conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

* Created a script to locate the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume".


### Results:

* Submited a screen shot each year of the results on the Multi Year Stock Data.

* Submited the VBA Scripts.
